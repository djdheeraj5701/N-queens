# N-queens

Try placing <i>N</i> queens on an <i>NxN</i> chessboard such that<br>
No two queens attack each other.

main.py contains the code used to achieve this task

It can be seen that for <i>N=8</i> we can get 92 such boards

The results are availble in output.txt as a matrix of characters<br>
and also in output_imgs folder as images with actual board and queen placement

<i>Happy learning</i> :)
